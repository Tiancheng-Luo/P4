<p><b>The local chart</b></p>

The most easy chart is the canonical one: just use the original (x,y) coordinates on screen.
This allows to study any finite region.  Example screen output:

<p><b>The U1 Chart</b></p>

Restricting to the set Z2>0, and using the transformation { x = 1/Z2, y = Z1/Z2 } one displays a part near infinity where x is much larger than 1.
In other words, one finds information near the ``eastern part of the poincare sphere''.
Example screen output:

The plot axes are the (Z2,Z1)-axes.  The line at infinity {Z2=0} is shown vertically in the middle, and the U1-chart is found to the right of this line.  To the left, one finds the V1' chart.  This V1' chart has a strong resemblence with the V1 chart but may be different, depending on the order of the vector field or the chosen Poincare-Lyapunov compactification weights.

<p><b>The U2 Chart</b></p>

Restricting to the set Z2>0, and using the transformation { x = Z1/Z2, y = 1/Z2 } one displays a part near infinity where y is much larger than 1.
In other words, one finds information near the ``northern part of the poincare sphere''.
Example screen output:
<p><center><img src="window_plotu2.png"></center></p>
The plot axes are the (Z1,Z2)-axes.  The line at infinity {Z2=0} is shown horizontally in the middle, and the U2-chart is found on top of this line.  On the bottom, one finds the V2' chart.  This V2' chart has a strong resemblence with the V2 chart but may be different, depending on the order of the vector field or the chosen Poincare-Lyapunov compactification weights.

In case p is even the V1' and U1' charts are not available.  In case q is even the V2' and U2' charts are not available.

<p><b>The V1 Chart</b></p>

Restricting to the set Z2>0, and using the transformation { x = -1/Z2, y = Z1/Z2 } one displays a part near infinity where -x is much larger than 1.
In other words, one finds information near the ``western part of the poincare sphere''.
The plot axes are the (Z2,Z1)-axes.  The line at infinity {Z2=0} is shown vertically in the middle, and the V1-chart is found to the right of this line.  To the left, one finds the U1' chart.  This U1' chart has a strong resemblence with the U1 chart but may be different, depending on the order of the vector field or the chosen Poincare-Lyapunov compactification weights.

<p><b>The V2 Chart</b></p>

Restricting to the set Z2>0, and using the transformation { x = Z1/Z2, y = -1/Z2 } one displays a part near infinity where -y is much larger than 1.
In other words, one finds information near the ``southern part of the poincare sphere''.
The plot axes are the (Z1,Z2)-axes.  The line at infinity {Z2=0} is shown horizontally in the middle, and the V2-chart is found on top of this line.  On the bottom, one finds the U2' chart.  This U2' chart has a strong resemblence with the U2 chart but may be different, depending on the order of the vector field or the chosen Poincare-Lyapunov compactification weights.

<p><b>Charts with Poincare-Lyapunov compactification</b></p>

The U1/V1/U2/V2 charts are computed similarly, but one attaches weights to the Z1 and Z2 variables.  When the U1/V1/U2/V2 charts are displayed, one does not see the dashed line (as the dashed circle in the above projection):
the plot is restricted to a view on the annulus around the dashed line.

<p><b>Similarities between the (U1,V1,U2,V2) and the (U1',V1',U2',V2') charts</b></p>

The vector field that is studied in the charts at infinity is first desingularized: one divides by a power of Z2, related to the degree of the vector field.  For that reason, when one compares the U1 with the U1' chart, it can happen that, aside from applying a reflection, the direction of integration needs to be reversed.
