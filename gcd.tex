\section{Overview}

Here, only one routine is implemented: \verb+my_gcd+, to calculate the greatest common divisor
of two multivariate polynomials.

\section{Implementation}

The routine \verb+my_gcd+ operates on two polynomials, and returns a list of three items.  The first
item is the reduced vector field (the list of two reduced polynomials).  If a non-trivial common
divisor is found, the second item is 1 and the third item is the common divisor.  If no divisor is
found, the second item is 0, and the third item is a dummy.  The routine is called in the very
beginning of the program sequence.

\subsection{Saving the routines in a library}

The routine is saved in a library "gcd.m".

\begin{lstlisting}[name=gcd]

save( my_gcd, "gcd.m" );
