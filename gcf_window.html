This window deals with the drawing of the <B>Greatest Common Factor</B>
between the two polynomials which compose the Polynomial Differential System. These
points will constitute one (or several) continuous set(s) of singular points
and their existence will modify the behaviour of the flow.
<br><ul>
<li>
    The Option Set <IMG SRC="field_appearance.png">&nbsp;will
    toggle between whether you get the line of singularities drawn as a sequence
    of dots or a set of dashes which link all these dots. Normally you will
    not see the difference between them unless you make a zoom.

<br></li>
<li>
    The integer input <IMG SRC="field_gcfpoints.png">&nbsp;will denote the number of
    unconditionally computed data points. As many points as you ask, the program
    will run slower but you will get greater exactitude.
    You may check a <B>REDUCE/MAPLE</B> manual for more information.

<br></li>
<li>
    The integer input <IMG SRC="field_gcfprecision.png">&nbsp;will define the maximum
    error that we are going to allow, understood as the negative exponent of a power
    of ten.

<br></li>
<li>
    The integer input <IMG SRC="field_maxmemory.png">&nbsp;will
    denote the amount of memory (in kilobytes) that we are willing to allow the computer to
    use for this task.

<br></li>
<li>
    The button <IMG SRC="button_evaluate.png">&nbsp;will start the draw of the
    <B>Greatest Common Factor </B>in the <A HREF="plot_window.html">Plot</A> window.
    This may take a bit, even with a trivial <B>Greatest Common Factor</B>.
    So you must wait until you see the green line(s) drawn.

    For evaluation, P4 uses Maple/Reduce.  You can view the output of Maple/Reduce in the
    <a href="output_window.html">Output</a> window.

<br></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> It is not possible to remove the curve of singular points once it has been drawn.</p>
