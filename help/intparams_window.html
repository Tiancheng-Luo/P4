<FONT SIZE=+1>In this window you may modify the parameters that affect to the integration
of separatrices and orbits through the <B>Runge-Kutta 7/8</B> method and
its graphical representation. They only should be modified if you are not
satisfied with the results you have got, and they must be tested in order
to chose the best set of values for the particular Polynomial Differential
System under study.
<br><ul>
<li>
    The Option Set <IMG SRC="field_originalreduced.png">&nbsp;is
    an option which only has meaning if there is a line of singularites, i.e. if the two components of the
    Polynomial     Differential System have a non-trivial common factor, or if the line at infinity of the Poincare
    Disc is filled with singular points. Then, you may choose between calculating the separatrices and orbits of the
    Polynomial Differential System either in the <i>original</i> system, or in the <i>reduced</i> one, that is, in
    the system with finitely many singularities.

<br></li><li>
    The Option Set <img SRC="field_dotsdashes.png">&nbsp;will toggle between whether you get the separatrices
    and orbits drawn as a sequence of dots or a set of dashes which link all these dots. Normally you will not see
    the difference between them unless you make a zoom.  Note that you can must make this choice <i>before</i> you
    integrate the separatrices, you cannot change the type of appearance of an orbit or separatrix that is already
    calculated.

<br></li><li>
    The input <IMG SRC="field_stepsize.png">&nbsp; gives
    the starting step size that we are using when we start to integrate orbits
    with the <B>Runge-Kutta 7/8</B> method. There is no reason for modifying
    it because the <B>Runge-Kutta 7/8</B> method improves the size of the step
    continuously to better follow the orbit.

<br></li><li>
    The field <IMG SRC="field_currentstepsize.png">&nbsp; gives the current step that <B>Runge-Kutta 7/8</B> method is
    using, so <B>P4</B> will use this step in the case you ask to continue integrating a separatrix or an orbit
    further more.

<br></li><li>
    The input <IMG SRC="field_maxstepsize.png">&nbsp;gives the maximum step size that we will allow when we integrate
    orbits with the <B>Runge-Kutta 7/8</B> method. Even if some orbits would accept a largest value without
    increasing the error, then the orbit that you would see would be a piecewise linear curve, so we suggest to
    leave this value unmodified as it is fast enough. On the contrary, this value may be too fast for certain
    systems, even producing erroneous crossings of separatrices and/or orbits.  In those cases you are advised to
    reduce this number and evaluate the plotting.

<br></li><li>
    The input <IMG SRC="field_minstepsize.png">&nbsp;gives the minimum step size that we will allow when we
    integrate orbits with the <B>Runge-Kutta 7/8</B> method. Same as before, this value does not need be modified
    unless you experience strange behaviours of separatrices close to points where it is highly sensitive to small
    changes. Anyway, this kind of separatrices will always be conflictive ones.

<br></li><li>
    The input <IMG SRC="field_tolerance.png">&nbsp;gives the value which will make <B>Runge-Kutta 7/8</B> method
    decide
    whether it must duplicate the integration step, or divide it by 2. If the difference of the values given by the
    two integrating functions embedded in the <B>Runge-Kutta 7/8</b> method is greater than this value, it means
    that we must use a smaller step. If this difference is lower than a cent of this value, then we may run a little
    more.

<br></li><li>
    The integer input <IMG SRC="field_points.png">&nbsp;gives the number of points
    that we will produce each time that we ask to integrate a separatrix or an orbit. This value can be increased
    without limit but we suggest that it should only be done to study special slow separatrices or orbits.
