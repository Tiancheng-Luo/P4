        Once you have entered into the program you will see the
        <A HREF="p4_window.html">P4</A> window:

        <P>
            <CENTER>
                <A HREF="p4_window.html">
                    <IMG SRC="window_find.png" border=0>
                </A>
            </CENTER>
        </P>

        You must provide a name (like ``example'' in the above picture) of a file that either exists (P4 will take it) or not (it
        will create a new one). By default all the input files have the extension
        <B>.inp</B>, so you do not need to enter it, simply the name. Now you press button
        <IMG SRC="button_find.png">. The window unfolds in a larger window:

        <P>
            <CENTER>
                <A HREF="p4_window.html">
                    <IMG SRC="window_find2.png" BORDER=0>
                </A>
            </CENTER>
        </P>

        Be sure that you have the
        <IMG SRC="field_runfile.png">&nbsp;and the <img SRC="field_saveall.png">&nbsp;option activated. In case you introduced the name of an existing
        file, now you must press
        <IMG SRC="button_load.png">. Otherwise, you will need to introduce a new differential system in the sub-window
        <P>
            <CENTER>
                <A HREF="vf_window.html"><img SRC="window_vf.png" BORDER=0></A>
            </CENTER>
        </P>
        (Pressing the <img src="button_vf.png">&nbsp;button will hide/show this subwindow. You could choose to hide the window
        after you enter the vector field, in order to save screen space.) Introduce a system using variables
        <B>x</B> and
        <B>y</B>. You may use the symbols
        <B>&quot;+&quot;</B>,
        <B>&quot;-&quot;</B>,
        <B>&quot;*&quot;</B>,
        <B>&quot;/&quot;</B>,
        <B>&quot;^&quot;</B>,
        <B>&quot;(&quot;</B>, and
        <B>&quot;)&quot;</B> apart from real numbers. You can also introduce special funtions as
        <B>sqrt()</B>,
        <B>sin()</B>,
        <B>cos()</B>,
        <B> tan()</B>,
        <B>ln()</B>,
        <B>exp()</B> in the coefficients of the Polynomial Differential System, and any other accepted by
        <B>REDUCE</B> or <b>MAPLE</b>. Be sure that what you introduce is a polynomial differential system on the variables
        <B>x</B> and
        <B>y</B>. Do not worry yet for the other options of this window. After you typed in the equations, your window may look like:
        <P>
            <CENTER>
                <A HREF="vf_window.html"><img SRC="window_vf2.png" BORDER=0></A>
            </CENTER>
        </P>
        You can close the subwindow by pressing the <img src="button_vf.png">&nbsp;button but it is not necessary at all.
        Now you are ready to study the system you have introduced. Simply go to the Vector Field window and press the button
        <IMG SRC="button_evaluate.png">. You will see the window from which you started the program that starts receiving information from it. Wait until
        it stops writting and you get a mesage like:

        <P>
            <CENTER>
                <IMG SRC="window_outputfinished.png">
            </CENTER>
        </P>

        Now you may plot the
        <B>Planar Polynomial Phase Portrait</B>. On top of the P4 window, you will find the plot button
        <A HREF="plot_window.html">
            <IMG SRC="button_plot.png" border=0>
        </A>. Press it to open the plot window:

        <P>
            <CENTER>
                <A HREF="plot_window.html">
                    <IMG SRC="window_plotsphere.png" border=0>
                </A>
            </CENTER>
        </P>

        You will see a circle representing the infinite and some symbols representing the singular points. You can get more information
        about them if you press the button
        <A HREF="legend_window.html">
            <IMG SRC="button_legend.png" BORDER=0>
        </A>&nbsp;where you get the keys we use to represent the different points and orbits:

        <P>
            <CENTER>
                <A HREF="legend_window.html">
                    <IMG SRC="window_legend.png" BORDER=0>
                </A>
            </CENTER>
        </P>

        Now you may press button
        <IMG SRC="button_plotallseps.png">&nbsp;and you will see as all separatrices of the
        <B>Planar Polynomial Phase Portrait</B> are drawn:

        <P>
            <CENTER>
                <A HREF="plot_window.html">
                    <IMG SRC="window_plotsep.png" border=0>
                </A>
            </CENTER>
        </P>

        In case that one (or several) singular point(s) were non elementary then some separatrices may not be drawn completely and
        you should refer to the wider explanation of this window to get them. In order to read all the information about
        the system you must press button
        <IMG SRC="button_view.png">&nbsp;in the
        <A HREF="p4_window.html">P4</A> window. Please note that this button includes a menu. So, if you press it you will see the two options of this button
        so you may chose between viewing information in a finite region and information at infinity. Now you may store the
        file you have introduced. Just press the button
        <IMG SRC="button_save.png">&nbsp;in the
        <A HREF="p4_window.html">P4</A> window. Now we are ready to leave the program. You may close the plot window by pressing the
        <IMG SRC="button_close.png">&nbsp;button, or by using the window close button
        <IMG SRC="button_winxpclose.png">&nbsp;. But if you press the
        <IMG SRC="button_quit.png">&nbsp;button in the
        <A HREF="p4_window.html">P4</A> window, you will close the program. You may also start a new study by changing the file in the
        <A HREF="p4_window.html">P4</A> window, or by entering a new system in the
        <A HREF="vf_window.html">Vector
Field</A> subwindow.
