<FONT SIZE=+1>This window is self-explanatory. It only contains the symbols and colors that
we are using to distinguish among the different singular points we may
find, and also the different colours we will use to draw the <B>separatrices</B>,
the <B>orbits</B>, the <B>lines of singularities</B> and the <B>limit cycles</B>.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Regarding singular points we want to remark that we will denote a point as a <B>weak
focus</B> when <B>P4</B> has not determined its stability. Moreover,
a <B>non-elementary </B>point will be a point non included in any other
category.</FONT>
