        Here you load or introduce the Polynomial Differential System you will study, adjust the parameters for the study, and execute
        the main part of the computations.

        <b>The first thing to do is to enter a name of the vector field file you want to open (or a name for a new file that you want to create).</b>        You type in the name in the <img src="field_name.png">&nbsp;field. Spaces in the filename are allowed. Default extension
        is <i>.inp</i>, but it is not necessary to manually add this extension. You can also use the <img src="button_browse.png">&nbsp;button
        to browse all directories for input files. Note that the file contents is not automatically loaded after you enter
        the name; you have to press the <img src="button_load.png">&nbsp; yourself.

            <!--<li>
                The Option Set
                <IMG SRC="field_maplereduce.png">&nbsp;will allow you to choose between two different computer algebra systems. On Windows, only Maple is
                supported. On Linux, you can choose between Maple and Reduce.
                <br></li>-->
            <li>
                The Option Set
                <IMG SRC="field_runprepare.png">&nbsp;will toggle you between two options. The default option is <i>Run File</i>. It will make the program
                to be executed completely making the study of the Polynomial Differential System and preparing everything
                to integrate every separatrix of it. Sometimes you may wish to select option <i>Prepare File</i>. This option
                generates a
                <!--<B>REDUCE</B> file (
                <B>.red</B>) or a --><b>MAPLE</b> file (<b>.txt</b>). Now you can run the file directely with
                <B><!--REDUCE/-->MAPLE</B>. You may be interested in this option if the amount of computations is very large and you prefer to run
                a
                <B><!--REDUCE/-->MAPLE</B> program in batch mode instead of running it in graphics-user-interface-mode.

                infinite ones, or make the study of only one finite singular point. In the later case you should introduce
                the point by entering its coordinates in
                <IMG SRC="field_x0.png">&nbsp;and
                <IMG SRC="field_y0.png">.

                option <i>yes</i> will fill that file with an exhaustive description of every step followed by the program.
