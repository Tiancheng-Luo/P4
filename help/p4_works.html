<font size=+1>
<br>
One of the most powerful tools of <B>P4</B> is that it is neither a simple
numeric program nor an algebraic one, but both things altogether. Some
parts of the program (like integration and <B>Lyapunov</B> constants) are
done always in numeric mode, but all the others can be done in numeric
mode or in algebraic one, or mixed, depending on the user 's options. In
order to do it, <B>P4</B> is written in <B>C/C++</B> and <B>REDUCE/MAPLE</B>. The
program goes running in <B>C</B>, but when it needs some algebraic computations,
it prepares a <B>REDUCE/MAPLE</B> file and asks this language to execute it and
produce an output in a certain format which <B>C </B>will read to continue
working.
<br>
<br>
We are going to explain mainly what <B>P4</B> does when you press the
button <IMG SRC="button_evaluate.png">&nbsp;in
the <A HREF="p4_window.html">P4</A>
window. It is assumed that you have already loaded an acceptable Polynomial
Differential System in the <A HREF="vf_window.html">Vector Field</A>
window and that you have selected all the default parameters.
<br>
<br>
First of all, <B>P4 </B>checks if there is a continuous set of finite singular
points, that is, if the two polynomial components of the system introduced
have a common factor. If they have, <B>REDUCE/MAPLE</B> will take it out and
will make the study of the reduced system, giving lately the option of
drawing the set of continuous singular points.
<br>
<br>
Now we must look for the finite isolated singular points. This can be done
in algebraic or numeric mode. In both cases the program will ask <B>REDUCE/MAPLE</B>
to solve the problem. <B>REDUCE/MAPLE</B> (like other computer algebra packages)
makes use of <B>GROEBNER</B> basis to solve this problem (if the system
is not linear). As this problem can be very complicated if the degree is
high, we suggest to work in numeric mode in such cases.
<br>
<br>
After this <B>P4</B> will determine the local phase portrait of each singular
point. So, it will look for the <B>Jacobian</B> of the system evaluated
at each singular point and will look for its eigenvalues. If the point
is a <B>(semi-)hyperbolic</B> <B>node</B> or a <B>strong focus</B>, we
are done. If the singular point is a <B>focus-center</B>, then <B>P4</B>
will look for its <B>Lyapunov</B> constants. This is done using the technique
developed by <B>Gasull</B> and <B>Torregrosa</B> .You may parametrize how
many <B>Lyapunov</B> constants you want to evaluate with the input
<A HREF="parameters_window.html"><IMG SRC="field_maxlevelweakness.png" border=0></A>&nbsp;in
the <A HREF="parameters_window.html">Parameters</A> subwindow. As many as you
ask, harder will be to find them. From this <B>P4</B> will be able to determine
if the point is a <B>center</B> (only in quadratic cases and a restricted
cubic case (linear plus homogeneous cubic)), an <B>unstable </B>or<B> stable
weak focus</B> of certain order if some of the computed <B>Lyapunov</B>
constants is positive or negative respectively, or an undetermined weak
focus if all the <B>Lyapunov</B> constants evaluated are zero.
<br>
<br>
If the singular point is a <B>(semi-)hyperbolic</B> <B>saddle</B> or a <B>saddle-node</B>,
then <B>P4</B> will normalize the system by moving the point to the origin
and the eigenvectors to the axis. Then <B>P4</B> determines the <B>Taylor</B>
approximations of the separatrices up to a certain degree in algebraic
mode (parameter <A HREF="parameters_window.html"><IMG SRC="field_levelapproximation.png" border=0></A>&nbsp;in
the <A HREF="parameters_window.html">Parameters</A> subwindow), and higher
degrees in numeric mode (parameter
<A HREF="parameters_windows.html"><IMG SRC="field_numericlevel.png" border=0></A>&nbsp;in
the <A HREF="parameters_window.html">Parameters</A> subwindow). Moreover, the
program will test if the <B>Taylor</B> expansion fits properly with the
real separatrix, and if not, it will evaluate a higher degree expansion
up to a maximum degree of <A HREF="parameters_windows.html"><IMG SRC="field_maximumlevel.png" border=0></A>&nbsp;in
the <A HREF="parameters_window.html">Parameters</A> subwindow.
<br>
<br>
In case of degenerate singular points, the program brings them to the origin
and starts making a detailed study by using the <B>BLOW-UP</B> technique
until it determines the exact distribution of its sectors, and the separatrices
it will have. For each one of them, also a Taylor approximation of the
separatrix is provided under the same conditions as explained above.
<br>
<br>
After doing the study of the finite singular points, a similar procedure is done
with the infinite ones.
