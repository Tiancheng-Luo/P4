<li>
    The Option Set <IMG SRC="field_algnum.png">&nbsp;will
    toggle between the two options showed here. In <i>Algebraic</i> mode
    some computation will be done in algebraic mode. These computations are
    the search of singular points (finite and infinite), and the first terms
    of the <B>Taylor</B> approximations of the separatrices. In <i>Numeric</i> mode,
    everything is done in numerics. You will need to use the <i>Numeric</i> mode
    if the degree of the Polynomial Differential System is high and it has
    many coefficients. This is somehow subjective, and the fact is that you
    will simply need to toggle to <i>Numeric</i> when
    you have already tried a system in the <i>Algebraic</i> mode and the program has collapsed.
<br></li>
<li>
    The Option Set <IMG SRC="field_testsep.png">&nbsp;will decide whether <B>P4</B> tests every <B>Taylor</B>
    approximation it has found, so it enters in a self-controlled procedure for improving it or
    not. Normally it is recommended to use this option, but if you see a concrete
    system where a separatrix is hard to deal with and you are not specially interested in it, you may
    deactivate this option.
<br></li>
<li>
    The input <IMG SRC="field_precision.png">&nbsp;gives the value (negative power of 10) such that we will consider
    any number below it (in module) as 0. In any numeric program you need to define such a number so to avoid that
    a rounding error may produce a variable being different from 0 when it should be null. Of course this may mean
    that you take as zero something that it should not, and so we allow this value to be modified. Anyway, if a
    problem depends greatly on such small values, its numerical study may be hazardous.
<br></li>
<li>
    The input <IMG SRC="field_epsilon.png">&nbsp;gives the distance we will move from the singular point in order to
    chose the first point of the integration for each separatrix. This value is the default one we will use for
    every separatrix. When we choose the initial point we are making an error which is directly proportional to
    this number elevated to the power of the <B>Taylor</B> approximation that we have done (greater or equal
    than input <IMG SRC="field_levelapproximation.png">&nbsp;explained in this same window). You may modify this
    number but it may be more interesting to modify it for individual slow separatrices and this can be done in the
    <A HREF="plot_separatrices_window.html">Plot Separatrices</A> window.
<br></li>
<li>
    The integer input <IMG SRC="field_levelapproximation.png">&nbsp;will determine the degree up to which the
    coefficients of the <B>Taylor</B> approximations of the separatrices will be done in any case. The computations
    will be done in the mode defined by the Option Set <IMG SRC="field_algnum.png">. If the Option Set
    <IMG SRC="field_testsep.png">&nbsp;is activated, then <B>P4</B> will test if the <B>Taylor</B> approximation
    fits properly with the vector field. In case it does not, it will look for one degree more and will repeat
    the test until the maximum degree (see below) is reached or the test passes.
<br></li>
<li>
    The procedure described above will continue being done in algebraic mode until we reach the value defined in
    the integer input <IMG SRC="field_numericlevel.png">. From now on, the computation will be done in numeric mode.
    We remark that <IMG SRC="field_numericlevel.png">&nbsp;must be larger than
    <img SRC="field_levelapproximation.png">.
<br></li>
<li>
    As this process needs to have an end, the integer input <IMG SRC="field_maximumlevel.png">&nbsp;is the
    maximum value
    we will allow for the separatrix. If the test fails up to this level, this will be explained in the report
    that <B>P4</B> will produce.
<br></li>
<li>
    The integer input <IMG SRC="field_maxlevelweakness.png">&nbsp;will determine the number of
    <B>Lyapunov</B> constants that we wish to calculate for every <B>focus-center</B> that <B>P4</B> may meet. We
    know that you may be very interested in getting a large number of them, but you must be careful as the time for
    computing them increases exponentialy. This can be a good reason to use the option
    <IMG SRC="button_prepare.png">&nbsp;in the <A HREF="p4_window.html">P4</A>
    window and then leave the <B>REDUCE/MAPLE</B> program running in batch mode.
<br></li>
<li>
    In the case you have selected to study all the singular points (or just the infinite ones) in the
    <A HREF="p4_window.html">P4</A> window, you will be asked to enter
    the values of the powers <IMG SRC="field_p.png">&nbsp;and <img SRC="field_q.png">&nbsp;which will define the
    <B>Poincare-Lyapunov Compactification</B>. By default these two numbers are <B>1</B>, and this leads
    to the standard <B>Poincare Compactification</B>.
<br></li>
<li>
    In the case you have selected to study only one singular point in the
    <A HREF="p4_window.html">P4</A> window, you will be asked to enter
    the coordinates of that point in the inputs <IMG SRC="field_x0.png">&nbsp;and <IMG SRC="field_y0.png">.
    Be sure to introduce a real singular point.  If you introduce parameters in the
    <a href="vf_window.html">Vector Field</a> window, you may use these parameters in the (x0,y0) fields as well.
