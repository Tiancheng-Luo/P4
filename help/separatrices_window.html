<FONT SIZE=+1>
This window will allow you to draw the separatrices one by one instead of getting
all them drawn at the same time by the button <IMG SRC="button_plotallseps.png">.
You can also use this window if you feel that the separatrices drawn by
<IMG SRC="button_plotallseps.png">&nbsp;are too short or even missed.

The
first thing you must do is select a singular point owning at least one
separatrix. You simply need to click the left button of your mouse while
pressing the <B>Shift</B> key of your keyboard close to the singular point.
You do not need to be much close; the program will select the closest singular
point owning separatrices. Once this is done you will see the coordinates
(in the Poincare or Poincare-Lyapunov Disc if suitable) of the point written
in your window.  You will see also how the <img SRC="field_epsilon.png">&nbsp;
default value apppears. If you had already some separatrices of this singular point
drawn, you may notice that one of them has changed its colour to gold.
This is the first separatrix you will study.

<br><ul>
<li>
    You can modify the input <IMG SRC="field_epsilon.png">&nbsp; by entering a new value.
    It gives the distance we will move from the critical point in order to chose the first point
    of the integration of each separatrix.
    This value is defined in the <A HREF="parameters_integration_window.html">Parameters
    of Integration</A> window. If you modify it here, this will not affect
    the global value, but thw program will use it to integrate the separatrices
    of the singular point you have chosen. It may be very useful when study
    slow separatrices of degenerated singular points. <br>
    <b>Remember always to press ENTER after entering the new value of epsilon!</b>

<br></li>
<li>
    The button <IMG SRC="button_integratesep.png">&nbsp;will start computing the selected separatrix from the
    beginning and using the epsilon value defined in this window. Once drawn you have the option
    to continue integrating it with the button <IMG SRC="button_continuesep.png">.

<br></li>
<li>
    The button <IMG SRC="button_selectnextsep.png">&nbsp;will select another separatrix of the same
    singular point but will not integrate it yet. This gives you a chance to modify the
    epsilon input per separatrix.

<br></li>
<li>
    The button <IMG SRC="button_integratenextsep.png">&nbsp;will select another separatrix of the same
    singular point and it will integrate it from the beginning and using the default
    epsilon value.  Once drawn you have the option to continue integrating it with the
    button <IMG SRC="button_continuesep.png">.

<br></li>
</ul>
If you want to select another singular point, you do not need to leave this
window; you may simply click a new point in the <A HREF="plot_window.html">Plot</A>
window in the way described above.

<p><b>Note:</b>It is not possible to delete separatrices once they have been drawn.</p>

In order to conveniently draw separatrices, you may also use the following keyboard shortcuts that work when the plot window is activated:
<br><ul>
<li>
    Shift+S: Start Integration of Separatrix (shortcut of <img src="button_integratesep.png">)
<li>
    Shift+C: Continue Integration of Separatrix (shortcut of <img src="button_continuesep.png">)
<li>
    Shift+N: Select Next Separatrix (shortcut of <img src="button_selectnextsep.png">)
<li>
    Shift+I: Integrate Next Separatrix (shortcut of <img src="button_integratenextsep.png">)
</ul>
