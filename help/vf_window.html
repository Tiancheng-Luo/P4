<FONT SIZE=+1>In this window (subwindow in the main <a href="p4_window.html">P4</a> window)
you will be able to introduce a Polynomial Differential System
or modify an existing one. The system can be written using parameters,
but you must provide a concrete value for each of them. This feature is given
to produce an easy way to modify systems inside a concrete parametric family.
You can also enter the common factor between the two polynomials if you
know it.
<br><ul>
<li>
    In the lines <IMG SRC="field_xdot.png">&nbsp;and <IMG SRC="field_ydot.png">&nbsp;you must
    introduce the Polynomial Differential System you wish. You must use the
    variables <B>x</B> and <B>y</B>. You may use the symbols <B>&quot;+&quot;</B>,
    <B>&quot;-&quot;</B>, <B>&quot;*&quot;</B>, <B>&quot;/&quot;</B>, <B>&quot;^&quot;</B>,
    <B>&quot;(&quot;</B>, and <B>&quot;)&quot;</B> apart from real numbers.

    You can also introduce special funtions as <B>sqrt()</B>, <B>sin()</B>,
    <B>cos()</B>,<B> tan()</B>, <B>ln()</B>, <B>exp()</B> in the coefficients
    of the Polynomial Differential System, and any other accepted by <B>MAPLE/REDUCE</B>.
    Be sure that what you introduce is a polynomial differential system on
    the variables <B>x</B> and<B> y</B>. Once you have introduced it, your
    window may look like

    <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="window_vf2.png"></CENTER></p>

    There is no limit on the length or the degree of the polynomial (except the
    limits imposed by MAPLE/REDUCE.)
<br></li><li>
    In the line <IMG SRC="field_gcf.png">&nbsp;you may introduce the Greatest Common Factor
    between the two polynomials which define the vector field, if you know it. Normally there
    will not exist a common factor, and so, you will leave the default input of <B>1</B>.
    In case that you suspect the existence of a common factor but you do not
    know it, then you must enter <B>0.</B> The program will do its best to look for it.
    But if you know it for any reason, you will help a lot the program if you give it here.
    In that case, you also must introduce the Polynomial Differential System that results
    after taking out the common factor. Of course, if you say that there is no common factor
    when there really exists a non trivial one, all you get is a computing error.
    <br>
    Thus, by default, one can leave the GCF field 0.
<br></li><li>
    If you have used any parameter, now you must enter a value for them. In the
    line <IMG SRC="field_numparams.png">&nbsp;you must enter the exact number of parameters you are using.
    Then the window will unfold like:
        <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="window_params0.png"></CENTER></p>
    and you will have to enter the name of the parameters you are using (case sensitive) and
    the value you assign to each one. The resulting window in case of one parameter may look like:
        <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="window_params.png"</CENTER></p>
<br></li><li>
    <b>Note: </b> If you make a change to the vector field or the paremeters, you have to re-evaluate in order
    to reflect the changes in the plot window or view windows.
<br></li>
