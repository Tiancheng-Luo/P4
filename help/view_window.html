<FONT SIZE=+1>In this window you can change the view of phase portrait.  You can choose a projection of the Poincare sphere or Poincare-Lyapunov sphere to the screen, a planar view that can be used to study the finite region,
or you can display one of the four charts at infinity.

<b>Detailed information on the charts at infinity (U1, U2, V1, V2) can be found
<a href="p4_charts.html">here</a>.</b>

<br><ul>
<li>
    The choices
    <p><center><img src="field_typeofview.png"></center></p>
    allow you to make a choice between the different views.  With a <b>spherical view</b>, you get a projection of
    the Poincare sphere (or Poincare-Lyapunov sphere) to a disc.  In this view, infinity is shown as a circle.
    <br>
    <br>
    In the <b>U1 chart</b>, infinity is shown as a vertical line in the middle of the plot window.  To the right of
    this line at infinity, the phase portrait in the U1 chart is drawn.  The left portion of the plot window is used
    to display the V1' chart, which has some symmetry w.r.t. the V1 chart.
    Similarly, in the <b>V1 chart</b>, infinity is shown as a vertical line in the middle of the plot window, to the
    right the V1 chart is drawn and to the left the U1' chart.
    <br>
    <br>
    In the <b>U2 chart</b>, infinity is shown as a horizontal line in the middle of the plot window.  On top of this
    line the phase portrait in the U2 chart is drawn.  The bottom portion of the plot window is used to display the
    V2' chart, which has some symmetry w.r.t. the V2 chart.
    Similarly, in the <b>V2 chart</b>, infinity is shown as a horizontal line in the middle of the plot window, on
    top of it the V2 chart, and below this line the U2' chart.
    <br>
    <br>
    In the <b>Planar view</b>, you get a rectangular portion of the finite x-y plane.  Information at infinity is
    not shown.

<br></li>
<li>
    In case of a spherical view, you can adapt the field <img src="field_projection.png">: it
    contains the (negative) <B>z</B> coordinate
    in <B>(0,0,z)</B> of the projection point from which you pass the points
    from the Poincare Sphere to the Poincare Disc. A very high value (in modulus)
    will mean an almost parallel projection. A  value close to zero will collapse
    the picture close to the origin and will give a better vision of the behaviour
    close to infinity. By default, the number is -<B>1</B>.

<br></li>
<li>
    In all other cases, you can enter the fields <img src="field_minx.png">, <img src="field_miny.png">,
    <img src="field_maxx.png">&nbsp;and <img src="field_maxy.png">&nbsp;to describe the rectangular region you want to display.
<br></li>
<li>
    To make it easy to use square regions, it suffices to enter one coordinate in the
    <img src="field_minx.png">&nbsp; field and press the <img src="button_square.png">&nbsp; button
    to complete the other coordinates accordingly.
<br></li>
</ul>

After you make your choice, you have to click somewhere in the <a href="plot_window.html">Plot</a> window in
order to execute the changes.
