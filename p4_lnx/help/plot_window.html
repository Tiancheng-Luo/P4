<FONT SIZE=+1>In this window you will be able to produce the phase portrait of the Polynomial
Differential System you are studying. It may appear in different versions depending on the options you are running.

<BR><OL>
<LI>
    The most usual will be the <B>Poincare Disc</B> version. In this one you will get a circle representing the
    infinity and some symbols representing the finite and infinite singular points of the Polynomial Differential
    System.
<br></li>
<LI>
    If you had modified the <IMG SRC="field_pq.png">&nbsp;values in the
    <A HREF="parameters_window.html">Parameters</A>
    subwindow of the main <a href="p4_window.html">P4</a> window. for the good natural numbers which allow the
    <B>Poincare-Lyapunov Compactification</B> of your Polynomial Differential System, you will get the
    <B>Poincare-Lyapunov Disc of degree (p,q)</B>.

        <p><center><img src="window_plotplsphere.png"></center></p>

    You will see
    two circles, in the inner circle you have all the finite singular points with modulus lower than one. If
    the modulus of a singular point is greater than 1, you will see it in the annulus limited by the circle of
    radius 1 and the infinity circle. Then <B>P4</B> makes a transformation of <B>x=cos(a)/r^p</B> and
    <B>y=sin(a)/r^q</B> where<B> a </B>is the polar angular coordinate. The values <B>p</B> and <B>q</B> have to be
    introduced by the user in the <A HREF="parameters_window.html">Parameters</A> window. By default they are 1 and
    that is equivalent to the standard <B>Poincare Disc</B>. You will be interested in this representation if you
    have one non-elementary singular point at infinity because then, with appropiate values of <B>p</B> and <B>q</B>
    you will see it splitted in elementary points.  You may see orbits crossing the circle of radius 1, and for
    such orbits it may appear as if they had non-continuous derivative. This is due to the fact that we are making
    two different transformations which cannot be connected in a differentiable way on such a circle.
<br></li>
<li>
    In case you decided to study only one singular point, you will see a planar representation of
    the neighbourhood of such a point.

<b>Buttons:</b>
<br><ul>
<li> The button <IMG SRC="button_close.png">&nbsp;will close this window but it will not stop the program.

<br></li>
<li> The button <IMG SRC="button_refresh.png">&nbsp;will clear the window and it will redraw everything evaluated
     up to now, so it may avoid any problem with the screen which may have appeared. It is useful once you have
     got all separatrices to bring up the singular points which may have been shadowed by the lines,
     or after you have deleted orbits.

<br></li>
<li> The button <IMG SRC="button_legend.png">&nbsp;will link you with the
     <A HREF="legend_window.html">Legend</A> window.

<br></li>
<li> The button <IMG SRC="button_orbits.png">&nbsp;will link you with the
     <A HREF="orbits_window.html">Orbits</A> window. You may also access to this window by simply selecting
     one point with the left button of your mouse, to be the initial conditions of the orbit you want
     to draw.

<br></li>
<li> The button <IMG SRC="button_intparams.png">&nbsp;will
     link you with the <A HREF="intparams_window.html">Parameters of Integration</A> window.

<br></li>
<li> The button <IMG SRC="button_gcf.png">&nbsp;will link you with the
     <A HREF="gcf_window.html">GCF</A> window.  This button is disabled if the vector field that you entered
     did not have a nontrivial greatest common factor.

<br></li>
<li> The button <img SRC="button_plotsep.png">&nbsp;will link you with
     the <A HREF="separatrices_window.html">Plot Separatrices</A> window. You may also access to this window
     by simply selecting one singular point (or close to it) with the left button of your mouse while
     maintaining pressed the <B>Shift</B> key of your keyboard.

<br></li>
<li> The button <IMG SRC="button_plotallseps.png">&nbsp;will start the execution of the integration program and
     it will draw every separatrix available. It is possible that some separatrices appear too short or even
     do not appear at all. This is due to the fact
     that we are integrating a fixed number of steps of the separatrix. This
     number is given in the option <IMG SRC="field_points.png">&nbsp;of the
     <A HREF="intparams_window.html">Parameters of Integration</A> window. You may either modify
     this number, or to go to the <A HREF="separatrices_window.html">Plot Separatrices</A> window to deal
     with these slow separatrices. We highly recommend the latter.

<br></li>
<li> The button <IMG SRC="button_limitcycles.png"</A> will link you with
     the <A HREF="limitcycles_window.html">Limit Cycles</A> window.

<br></li>
<li> The button <img SRC="button_plotview.png">&nbsp;will link you with the
     <A HREF="view_window.html">Plot View</A> window.  This will allow you to view the phase portrait in
     one of the charts at infinity, such as the U1 chart:

     <p><center><img src="window_plotu1.png"></center></p>

     The circle at infinity is in this chart shown as a line of infinity.  To the right of this line, one
     finds the U1 chart; to the left of this line the V1' chart is shown.
     More information on the charts at infinity is found <a href="p4_charts.html">here</a>.

<br></li>
<li> The button <img SRC="button_print.png">&nbsp;will link you with the
     <A HREF="print_window.html">Print</A> window.
<br></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><b>Zooming:</b></p>
Even there is no special button, you may make a <B>ZOOM</B> of any rectangle of the Plot window.
In order to do it you must press the left button of your mouse together with the <B>Control</B> key of
your keyboard on the left-up corner. Then you release the <B>Control</B> key and move your mouse
towards the right-down corner. You will see as a rectangle is formed. Then you click the left button of
your mouse in the right-down corner and you will get the <B>ZOOM</B> window:

        <P><CENTER><IMG SRC="window_zoom.png"></CENTER></P>

In this window you also have the buttons <IMG SRC="button_close.png">, <IMG SRC="button_refresh.png">&nbsp;
and <IMG SRC="button_print.png">&nbsp;which work exactly in the same way as described above.

You are not limited to do only one <B>ZOOM</B>, you may do as many as you want.

<b>Changing the size of the plot/zoom windows:</b>

The plot and zoom windows are resizable, just like any other window on your computer.  While resizing,
you will see that the "aspect ratio" is displayed on the bottom bar:

        <P><CENTER><IMG SRC="window_zoomaspectratio.png"></CENTER></P>

If this aspect ratio is 1.0000, then you have rescaled your window in an euclidean way.  In the picture
above, the aspect ratio is 0.6333 because only the width of the window was decreased and the height
remained the same.
