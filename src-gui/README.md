# P4 (Polynomial Planar Phase Portraits) [src-gui]

## Description

P4 is a software that is able to draw the planar phase portrait for any polynomial differential system on the Poincaré or Poincaré-Lyapunov compactified planes.

## Files

* **src-gui**:
    * **p4**: C++/Qt source code for the GUI of P4,
    * **lyapunov**: C++ code for numerical computation of Lyapunov constants
    * **separatrice**: C++ code for numerical computation of separatrices

## Build from source

Generally, only source from *src-gui* needs to be compiled. Check [the main README file](../README.md "Main readme") for instructions on every possible way of building P4.
