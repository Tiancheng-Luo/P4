
Mplstrip is an utility that is used in the process
of building P4's Maple files.

The P4 source code that is used inside Maple is
written during development directly inside a LaTeX format.
The parts of this .tex files that contain code can be extracted
using Mplstrip, and can then be compiled.

Once compiled, there is no need to keep Mplstrip on your system.
